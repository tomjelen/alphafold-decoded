So far, we extracted `extra_msa_feat`, `residue_index`, `target_feat` and `msa_feat` from the sequence alignment data during feature extraction. The embedding of these features is done in three steps:\n",

    "2. `RecyclingEmbedder`: Denoted with 'R' in the diagram below. Alphafold is run multiple times, and the transformed pair and MSA representations, as well as the predicted atom positions, are fed back into the new iterations via the RecyclingEmbedder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `ExtraMsaStack`: The extra MSA stack feeds in additional data from the sequences in the alignment that were not selected as cluster centers. It is architecturally similar to the Evoformer, and we can reuse almost all primitives from it.\n",
